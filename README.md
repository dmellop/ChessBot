# ChessBot
Deep Learning 


Dependencies I've installed (on Anaconda 4.2)
tensorflow
python-chess

both installed via pip

Using python-chess to load in pgn files from http://www.ficsgames.org/cgi-bin/download.cgi


I'm also using the website we mentioned in the proposal-- he has several good functions for reading in pgn files and parsing them in to somethign useful. Think its fair game for us to use-- I had to make adjustments because it seemed like python-chess has updaed

(I'm also on python 3.5.x)
